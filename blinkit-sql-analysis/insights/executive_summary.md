## Executive Funnel Summary

### Funnel Overview
The majority of placed orders successfully progress through delivery, resulting in a high delivery success rate.

There is minimal drop-off between order placement and delivery completion.

Operational execution effectively converts demand into realized outcomes.

### Key Risks
The order-to-delivery funnel is healthy and efficient, with limited value leakage.

Growth initiatives are not being undermined by operational failures.

Revenue potential generated at checkout is largely realized, not lost downstream.

### Strategic Recommendations
Maintain current operational standards, as delivery reliability supports sustainable growth.

Use funnel success metrics as a confidence signal when scaling marketing or promotions.

Continue monitoring funnel performance to quickly detect early signs of operational strain as volume increases.
