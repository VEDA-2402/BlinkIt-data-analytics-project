## Delivery Reliability vs Growth Insights

### Key Observations
Overall delivery reliability remains strong, with most periods showing low or zero delivery issue rates.

Delivery performance is consistent across time, suggesting that current operational capacity is generally sufficient to handle demand.

Isolated spikes in delivery issues appear sporadic rather than systemic, indicating localized or short-term disruptions instead of structural problems.

### Business Risks
Delivery operations are not currently a bottleneck for growth, which is a positive signal for scaling order volume.

Stable delivery performance during higher-order periods suggests effective capacity planning and routing efficiency.

Occasional delivery issues are more likely driven by external or temporary factors rather than core operational weaknesses.

### Recommendations
Maintain current delivery capacity and routing strategies, as they are supporting reliable performance at scale.

Implement targeted monitoring for days or periods with unusual delivery issue spikes to enable quick corrective action.

Use delivery reliability as a competitive advantage in customer messaging, reinforcing trust and service consistency.
