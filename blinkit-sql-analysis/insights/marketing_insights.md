## Marketing Efficiency & Customer Quality Insights

### Key Observations
Marketing channels differ significantly in the quality of customers acquired, not just in acquisition volume.

Some channels consistently bring customers with higher repeat orders and higher average revenue, indicating stronger long-term value.

Other channels attract customers who place fewer orders, suggesting weaker engagement after acquisition.

### Business Risks
Marketing performance should not be evaluated purely on customer acquisition counts.

Channels acquiring low-engagement customers may inflate growth metrics while contributing limited long-term value.

High-quality channels play a critical role in building a sustainable and profitable customer base.

### Recommendations
Prioritize investment in channels that acquire customers with higher repeat behavior and revenue contribution.

Reassess or optimize campaigns from low-quality channels to improve post-acquisition engagement.

Track marketing success using downstream customer behavior metrics (orders and revenue), not just acquisition volume.
