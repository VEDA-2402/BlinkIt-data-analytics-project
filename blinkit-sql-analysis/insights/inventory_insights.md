## Inventory Capital Efficiency Insights

### Key Observations
Most top-performing products fall into the “Balanced Performer” segment, indicating a healthy mix of unit volume and revenue per unit.

Revenue generation is driven by moderate order volumes combined with reasonable pricing, rather than extreme dependence on either high volume or premium pricing.

Core categories such as Fruits & Vegetables, Grocery & Staples, Baby Care, and Dairy consistently contribute to stable sales efficiency.
### Business Risks
Product performance is stable and predictable, with no immediate signs of inefficiency or over-reliance on low-value volume.

The current product mix supports sustainable revenue generation without operational stress.

Pricing and demand appear well-aligned across categories, reducing margin volatility.

### Recommendations
Maintain current pricing and promotion strategies for balanced performers, as they form a reliable revenue base.

Use balanced products as anchors for bundles and cross-sell to increase basket size.

Monitor emerging products to identify potential high-value, low-volume opportunities for premium positioning.
