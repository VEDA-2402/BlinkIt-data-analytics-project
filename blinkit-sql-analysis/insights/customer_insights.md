## Customer Economics & Retention Insights

### Key Observations
- Top revenue-generating customers show zero delivery issues, indicating strong operational reliability for high-value users.

- High-value customers also exhibit higher average order values, reducing per-order delivery cost.

- One-time and low-value customers form a large share of the customer base but contribute limited long-term revenue.

### Business Risks
- Operational performance is not a risk factor for high-revenue customers.

- Delivery systems are currently optimized for customers who matter most financially.

- Revenue leakage, if any, is more likely driven by low-value or one-time customers, not by delivery failures among top customers.

### Recommendations
- Protect and retain high-value customers through loyalty programs and consistent service quality.

- Avoid unnecessary operational changes for top customers, as delivery reliability is already strong.

- Re-evaluate spend and incentives for low-value or one-time customers to improve overall customer quality.
