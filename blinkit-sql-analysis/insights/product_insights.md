## Product Portfolio Health Insights

### Key Observations
Top revenue-generating products show zero delivery issues, indicating stable and reliable fulfillment across high-performing SKUs.

Products across categories such as Fruits & Vegetables, Baby Care, Pharmacy, and Grocery demonstrate consistent operational performance.

Revenue concentration is driven by products with moderate order volumes but high average order values, rather than extreme demand spikes.

### Business Risks
Delivery reliability is not a current constraint for high-performing products.

The product portfolio appears operationally stable, with no immediate delivery-related risk among top SKUs.

Product performance differences are driven more by pricing and basket composition than by fulfillment issues.

### Recommendations
Maintain current fulfillment and logistics strategies for top-performing products, as delivery performance is strong.

Focus product optimization efforts on demand growth and cross-sell, rather than operational fixes.

Use high-performing products as anchors for promotions and bundles, since they do not introduce delivery risk.
